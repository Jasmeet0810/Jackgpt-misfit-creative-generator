# 🌀 JackGPT: The Misfit Creative Generator

Welcome to **JackGPT** — a playful, AI-powered creative tool that generates unconventional brand experience ideas based on your prompt and creative alter ego. Whether you dream in surreal metaphors, think in data points, or break every rule in the book, JackGPT gives your brand idea a voice. Or rather... three voices.

> _"Because the best creative work doesn’t come from the middle. It comes from the misfits."_

## 🎭 Choose Your Creative Persona

- **🧠 The Analyst**  
  Data-driven. Strategic. Always one foot in the spreadsheet.  
  > “According to Q2 trend analysis, your idea scores a +67 on the Virality Index.”

- **🎭 The Dreamer**  
  Poetic. Abstract. Lives in metaphor and moonlight.  
  > “Your café floats between clouds, offering conversations steeped in stardust.”

- **😈 The Rebel**  
  Bold. Chaotic. Hates convention.  
  > “No brand book. No rules. Just espresso, neon, and a middle finger to tradition.”
